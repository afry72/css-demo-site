# css-demo-site

## Description
this demo site was created to show how small and simple changes can make a huge difference to the accesibility of a page.
i started by taking the provided code for a website made for a marketing agency and modified the code. The code started out
as a bunch of unlabled div's with a few minor bugs, by labling all of the divs into semantic terms and adding alts to the images
the website is so muche easier to view and read from the code and able to be used with a screen reader. After adding some labels
i noticed one of the nav links wasnt working due to a lack of ID which was assesed and fixed rather quickly.
